## How to Use
Touring Bot 2.0 is designed to streamline data entry about where artists have performed, when, and with whom. Hereâ€™s how to use the bot:

1. **Provide Data**: Input your data about artists, performances, or festivals. This can be in the form of text, images, or web links.
2. **Specify Requirements**: Let the bot know specific details or formats you require for your data organization.

Because touringbot uses natural language instructions, it can probably be deployed on other LLM systems, though this has not been tested. To view touringbot's current prompt, look at the prompt folder.

Sample datasets will be added at a later date.

## Documentation
Further documentation of touringbot will be added on an ongoing basis.
